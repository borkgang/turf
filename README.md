Info
-----------
<div align ="center">
With the project starting on 22/06/17 under the name "Sparrow Reborn", Turf is about ease of access and simplicity.
From the start, it had been a goal of mine to make a decent framework that people can learn from. Turf has done this. With a simplistic coding style for beginners, and a not-so-eyestraining code process for seasoned programmers, Turf is one of bork gang's most promising projects of the coming years.

Using a std::map-based command parsing function, we are able to efficiently handle errors and commands with up to 3 parameters stock.

Made in a little under 2 months on and off, built on efficiency, readability, and simplicity.
